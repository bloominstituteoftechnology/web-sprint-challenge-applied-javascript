# Applied JavaScript Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Applied JavaScript**. During this sprint, you studied **DOM and components**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **an online Lambda newspaper**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge.

## Project Set Up

- [ ] Fork and clone the repo. Delete your old fork from Github first if you are repeating this Unit.
- [ ] Open the assignment in Canvas and click on the "Set up git" option.
- [ ] Push your first commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "first commit" && git push`.
- [ ] Check to see that Codegrade has accepted your git submission.

## Project Instructions

### Introduction

You are going to create a Lambda Newspaper. Your job is going to be to create the components that make up the newspaper's home page.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your project should look similar to the image linked below:

[Lambda Times](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/cac4803c-6e8f-4846-be0e-b20d82a34a73_lambda-times.png)

### Instructions

- [ ] Navigate to the root of the project with your command line.
- [ ] Run `npm install` to download the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
- [ ] Run `npm start` to compile the project and serve it.
- [ ] Navigate Chrome to `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] In a separate terminal, run `npm test` to run tests.

**Steps Required for MVP:**

- [ ] Steps 1 and 2 are explained inside the `src/components/header.js` file.
- [ ] Steps 3 and 4 are explained inside the `src/components/tabs.js` file.
- [ ] Steps 5 and 6 are explained inside the `src/components/card.js` file.

**Important Notes:**

- Please **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- If your development server stops "auto reloading", manually kill it with `CTRL+C` and restart it.
- Do not change the `package.json` file except to install libraries with NPM (Axios is _already_ in the `package.json`).
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and polish your work, including spell-checking and grammar-checking.
- It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Submission format

- [ ] Submit via Codegrade by committing and pushing any new changes to the *main* branch.
- [ ] Check Codegrade for automated feedback.
- [ ] Check Codegrade in the days following the Sprint Challenge for reviewer feedback.
- [ ] Any changes pushed after the deadline will not receive any feedback.

## Interview Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following questions:

1. What is the DOM?
DOM (the document object model) is a representation of the HTML that makes up a web page. It represents the page structure as a series of parents and children. Almost any time a website does something, it's because JavaScript can access and act upon the page and its HTML through the DOM -- e.g. buttons and alerts.

2. What is an event?
An event is when something "happens" on a page -- mostly when the user interacts with my page in some way. Events tell JavaScript to respond in some way -- e.g. to display an alert when the user loads a page. Examples of events include clicks, page loads, mouse movements over/in/out of an element, pressing or unpressing a key, and resizing the window.

3. What is an event listener?
Event listeners are functions that perform an action when an event they're "listening for" happens. For example, I can program an alert that changes the background color of my page from white to black when the user clicks on my light-bulb image. My code is "listening for" the click (the event) and then executes some code in response (changes the background color).

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Because NodeLists don't have many of the Array-like properties (forEach, map, slice etc) and we can't use methods on them.

5. What is a component?
Components are reusable pieces of code, e.g. a dropdown menu.
